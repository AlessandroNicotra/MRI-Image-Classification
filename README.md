# MRI-Image-Classification

Image Classifcation made with PyTorch on the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) found on Kaggle.

The model is trained with *train.py* using a Convolutional Neural Network and *test.py* can be used to test the trained model in the *model* folder. The CNN used can be found in *cnn.py*.

The *model* folder contains images to show the model's performance in the training phase.
